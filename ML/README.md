# Machine Learning Portfolio

The initial idea of this porfolio is to create one instance of ever ML technique covered in the *Machine Learning Specialization* by Coursera.

The model to implement are:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Softmax for multiclass problems
- Neural Networks
- Decision Trees & Tree Ensembles
- K-means Clustering
- Anomaly Detection
- Collaborative Filtering
- Content-based Filtering
- Reinforcement Learning
