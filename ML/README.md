# Machine Learning Portfolio

The initial idea of this porfolio is to create one instance of ever ML technique covered in the *Machine Learning Specialization* by Coursera.

The model to implement are:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Softmax for multiclass problems
- Neural Networks
- Decision Trees & Tree Ensembles
- K-means Clustering
- Anomaly Detection
- Collaborative Filtering
- Content-based Filtering
- Reinforcement Learning

## Linear Regression

### About Dataset

The Ames Housing Dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine
learning and data analysis. It contains various features and attributes of
residential homes in Ames, Iowa, USA. The dataset is often used for regression
tasks, particularly for predicting housing prices.

Here are some key details about the Ames Housing Dataset:

- Number of Instances: The dataset consists of 2,930 instances or observations.
- Number of Features: There are 79 different features or variables that describe
  various aspects of the residential properties.
- Target Variable: The target variable in the dataset is the "SalePrice,"
  representing the sale price of the houses.
- Data Types: The features include both numerical and categorical variables,
  covering a wide range of aspects such as lot size, number of rooms, location,
  construction, and more.

The Ames Housing Dataset is widely used in the machine learning community for
tasks such as regression modeling, feature engineering, and predictive analytics
related to housing prices. It serves as a valuable resource for developing and
testing machine learning algorithms and techniques in the real estate domain.
