# Portfolio

The idea of this repo is to create a portfolio of all the different aspects
where I have some relevant experience. Currently, these are the following areas
where I have experience:

- Machine Learning (and Data Science in general)
- Web Development
- Mobile Development
- Game Development

Each of these areas [should] have their own relevant README.md with their respective details.
